# Odin Library Project
Library Project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s JavaScript course

Functionality is very basic at the moment. There's one sample book card. You can add and remove books, and toggle the read status.

Future plans include validation of the form (both native and JS) and hopefully actually saving the data.

Will for me act as a precursor to a later project relating to reading orders.
